# Cube-ML-Assignment

## Project Overview

This project explores and compares classical **search algorithms** — DFS, BFS, and A* — for solving a simplified **2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube**. It was created as part of a university assignment to understand how these algorithms behave in real puzzle-solving tasks.

The project focuses on:
- Understanding algorithm behavior.
- Measuring execution time and solution steps.
- Visualizing the step-by-step solving process.

## Key Features

- Custom Python implementation of a **2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube** model.
- Search algorithms implemented from scratch:
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - A* Search (with a heuristic)
- Random cube **scrambler** to simulate real-world problems.
- Terminal-based **visual output** of cube state at every step.
- Execution **time tracking** and path comparison.
